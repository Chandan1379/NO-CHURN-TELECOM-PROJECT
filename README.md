# ðŸ“ž No-Churn Telecom Prediction

This project predicts customer churn using machine learning. It helps telecom companies identify customers who are likely to leave, so they can take action to retain them.

# ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

# ðŸ“Œ What I Did

1. Cleaned and explored the dataset
2. Visualized key trends with EDA
3. Handled missing and categorical data
4. Built models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
5. Evaluated model performance (accuracy, precision, recall)
6. Shared insights to reduce churn
